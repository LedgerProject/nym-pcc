# Nym Private COVID Certificate (PCC)

The existing Digital Covid Certificates (including the European DCC) do not provide strong privacy
properties. They can expose unnecessary information about an individual and are not resistant to forgery if the underlying cryptography is compromised. Worse, they can further be used to create a map of the places the person has visited and therefore be used as a tracking system. 


We propose a privacy enhanced version using blinded and re-randomizable
Coconut credentials that can tackle the above issues. We call this product
Private Covid Certificate (PCC). PCC is an extension of Nym's Digital Identity system which also uses Coconut as the underlying technology.
