# Nym Private COVID Certificate (PCC)

The existing Digital Covid Certificates do not provide strong privacy
properties, it can expose a lot of information about an individual, and
can further be used to create a map of the places the person has visited
and therefore be used as a tracking system.

We propose a privacy enhanced version using blinded and re-randomizable
Coconut credentials that can tackle the above issues. We call this product
Private Covid Certificate (PCC).
