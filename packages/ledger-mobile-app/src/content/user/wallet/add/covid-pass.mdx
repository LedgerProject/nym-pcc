Users can add the COVID certificate issued by their health authority by scanning the QR code.

The QR is decoded and if the name and date of birth of the user in the certificate matches that of Nym Id, the certificate will be added to their wallet. Later the digital certificate can be used to generate private credentials, allowing the user to select which part of the data in the private certificate to disclose to the verifier.
