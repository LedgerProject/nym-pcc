When a user is required to show a COVID pass, the verifier can create a QR code that contains a policy defining what information they require.

The user will scan this code and be shown the information the verifier is requesting. They will be able to agree or decline the request, or
provide less information. It is then up to the verifier to make a decision based on the information disclosed.
