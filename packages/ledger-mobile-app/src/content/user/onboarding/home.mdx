Users start using the app by authenticating with the country of residence's health care provider.

They need to provide a unique identifier e.g. in the UK this will be their NHS Number.

*Note: this app does not currently implement this part of the flow, as this is not the problem the app is trying to solve. User authentication requires human operators or integrations with
a number of varied government services that have long accreditation processes and are different country to country.*
