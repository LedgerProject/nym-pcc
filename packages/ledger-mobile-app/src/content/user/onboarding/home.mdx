Users start using the app by creating a Nym Id.

In order to authenticate their identity they need to either:

- provide a government issued document that will be verified by a human operator
- authenticate with the government ID service (not all governments offer this to citizens)

*Note: this app does not currently implement this part of the flow, as this is not the problem the app is trying to solve. User authentication requires human operators or integrations with
a number of varied government services that have long accreditation processes and are different country to country.*
