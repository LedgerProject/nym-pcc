When users start using the app, they need to create Nym Passport.

In order to authenticate their identity they need to either:

- provide a government issued document that will be verified by a human operator
- authenticate with the government ID service (not all governments offer this to citizens)

*Note: this app does not currently implement this part of the flow, as it would require human operators and integrations with
a large number of varied government services that have long accreditation processes.*
