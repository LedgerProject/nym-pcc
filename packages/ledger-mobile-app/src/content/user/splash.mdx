The end user will download an app where they can:

- authenticate with their health provider to download a clear text copy of their COVID vaccination certificate
- generate a randomised private COVID pass, that can be shown at venues that use the Verifier app
- the user can scan a venue's QR code to see what information they want to have verified before showing a randomised COVID pass
